## Project as part of the studies

# Stages in the project:
- Creating a class diagram

- Creating the maze using DFS, BFS and Best First Search algorithms

- Compression of the maze for the purpose of saving and loading, integration in the pattern decorator of the streams in java.

- Client server and Threads: Using a thread pool so that the generic server will handle several clients at the 
  same time, you can choose in the settings how many threads will be in the thread pool.

  The server saves the solution to the mazes it receives on disk, each solution is saved in a separate file.
  The mazes that the server solves can be saved in a temporary folder.

  The server can retrieve the already solved solution from the file and return it to the client without solving 
  again.

 - Running tests using JUnit
- Desktop application in MVVM architecture
- OOP
- GUI using JavaFX
- Every creation and solution of a maze is saved in the Log cube using the Log4j2 library
- Adherence to SOLID principles
- Abstraction
- Correct encapsulation
- Code documentation using Javadoc
- Desktop application in architecture
